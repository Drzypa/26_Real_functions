A solenoidal vector field is one that satisfies $$\vnabla\cdot\vB = 0$$
at every point where the vector field $\vB$ is defined. Here $\vnabla\cdot\vB$ is the divergence.

This condition actually implies that there exists a vector $\vA$, such that
$$\vB = \vnabla\times\vA.$$

For a function $f$ satisfying Laplace's equation $$\vnabla^2f = 0,$$ it follows that $\vnabla f$ is solenoidal.
