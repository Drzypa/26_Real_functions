<p class="ltx_p">Brief Description
The non-Newtonian calculi are alternatives to the classical calculus of Newton and Leibniz. They provide a wide variety of mathematical tools for use in science, engineering, and mathematics.
There are infinitely many non-Newtonian calculi. Like the classical calculus, each of them possesses, among other things: a derivative, an integral, a natural average,Â a special class of functions having a constant derivative, and two Fundamental Theorems which reveal that the derivative and integral are ’inversely’ related. Nevertheless, most non-Newtonian calculi are markedly different from the classical calculus.Â Â Â Â  â¨Â Â Â Â  â¨For example, infinitely many non-Newtonian calculi are nonlinear in the sense that each of them has a nonlinear derivative or integral. Among these calculi are the geometric calculus, bigeometric calculus, harmonic calculus, biharmonic calculus, quadratic calculus, and biquadratic calculus. Furthermore, in the geometric calculus and in the bigeometric calculus, the derivative and integral are both multiplicative. (Please see the Multiplicative Calculus section of this website.)
Of course, in the classical calculus the linear functions are the functions having a constant derivative. However, in the geometric calculus, the exponential functions are the functions having a constant derivative. And in the bigeometric calculus, the power functions are the functions having a constant derivative. (The geometric derivative and the bigeometric derivative are closely related to the well-known logarithmic derivative and elasticity, respectively.)â¨â¨The well-known arithmetic average (of functions) is the natural average in the classical calculus, but the well-known geometric average is the natural average in the geometric calculus. And the well-known harmonic average and quadratic average (or root mean square) are closely related to the natural averages in the harmonic and quadratic calculi, respectively.â¨â¨Furthermore, unlike the classical derivative, the bigeometric derivative is scale invariant (or scale free), i.e., it is invariant under all changes of scale (or unit) in function arguments and in function values.
Non-Newtonian calculus has been applied in a variety of scientific, engineering, and mathematical fields. In particular, the geometric and bigeometric calculi have been used extensively. For more information, please see the Applications and Citations sections of this website.</p>

Such is the case with the invention of general algebra, with the differential calculus, and in a more limited region with Lagrange’s calculus of variations, with my calculus of congruences, and with Mobius’ calculus. Such conceptions unite, as it were, into an organic whole countless problems which otherwise would remain isolated and require for their separate solution more or less application of inventive genius.”</p>

</div>
<div id="p13" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">”This [Non-Newtonian Calculus] is an exciting little book, for two reasons: first, its content, and second, its presentation. The content consists primarily of a brief nonaxiomatic description of the fundamentals of various calculi …</p>
</div>
<div id="p14" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">”For each calculus, a gradient, a derivative, and an average are defined; a basic theorem (essentially a mean-value theorem) is stated; an integral is defined; and a fundamental theorem of integral calculus is stated. In Chapter 1, the authors review the essentials of Newtonian calculus and establish the format of presentation that they follow in the later chapters on the various non-Newtonian calculi. Classical problems studied by such men as Galileo and Newton provide examples of, and motivation for, the authors’ work. The authors’ reference to these problems serves to emphasize the relevance of their results to the concerns of modern science. The greatest value of these non-Newtonian calculi may prove to be their ability to yield simpler physical laws than the Newtonian calculus. Throughout, this book exhibits a clarity of vision characteristic of important mathematical creations.</p>
</div>
<div id="p15" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">”The authors have written this book for engineers and scientists, as well as for mathematicians. They have made a dramatic break with tradition and omitted all proofs and many of the mathematical details that place so much of contemporary mathematics writing out of the reach of scientists and engineers. Instead, they have included details that help develop an intuitive conception of their calculi and relate their calculi to well-knows classical problems. The authors apparently feel that their results are of sufficient importance to scientists and engineers to justify these departures from the more traditional style of writing in mathematics. The writing is clear, concise, and very readable. No more than a working knowledge of [classical] calculus is assumed. Mathematicians who feel that their results are of importance to scientists and engineers, but who find little interest among those workers for their results, might consider presenting their work as Grossman and Katz have done. This would do much to reopen channels of communication between mathematicians and scientists and do much to advance both disciplines.”</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Thanks to David Lukas and Kenneth Lukas for their expert advice about the Internet and website construction. In 2003, they suggested the idea of using the Internet to broadcast information about non-Newtonian calculus. Dave, who set up the first NNC website, is a computer engineer. Ken, a talented musician, uses the computer to compose music and to create videos and movies. They knew that posting information on the Internet would be an effective way to inform people about non-Newtonian calculus. That information has turned out to be of considerable interest to many researchers who until they read about it on the Internet knew nothing about non-Newtonian calculus, but subsequently found applications in various fields.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The geometric and bigeometric calculi have been the two most often used non-Newtonian calculi. In each of these two calculi, the use of multiplication/division to combine/compare numbers is crucial.</p>
</div>
<div id="p29" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Each of these two calculi is a ’multiplicative calculus’ in the sense that its derivative and integral are multiplicative operators.

</div>
<div id="p30" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Because there are many multiplicative calculi,Â  the expression ”the multiplicative calculus” should be avoided, and no one specific calculus should be named ”multiplicative calculus”. Nevertheless, some authors have used the name ”multiplicative calculus” for the geometric calculus, while others have used the same name for the bigeometric calculus. It is hoped that the scientific community will soon reach accord with regard to names for these two calculi. Our suggestion is simply to use the names ”geometric calculus” and ”bigeometric calculus”, respectively. Interestingly, this matter is discussed by Dorota Aniszewska and Marek Rybaczuk in their article ”Multiplicative HÃ©non map” [288].</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The non-Newtonian calculi were created in the period from 1967 to 1970 by Michael Grossman and Robert Katz. In July of 1967, they created an infinite family of calculi that includes the classical calculus, the geometric calculus, the harmonic calculus, and the quadratic calculus. In August of 1970, they created infinitely-many other calculi, including the bigeometric calculus, the anageometric calculus, the biharmonic calculus, the anaharmonic calculus, the biquadratic calculus, and the anaquadratic calculus. All of the calculi can be described simultaneously within the framework of a general theory. They decided to use the adjective ”non-Newtonian” to indicate any of the calculi other than the classical calculus.

Subsequently, with Jane Grossman, they wrote several other books/articles on non-Newtonian calculus, and on related matters such as weighted calculus, meta-calculus, averages, and means.

<p class="ltx_p">Michael Grossman and Robert Katz began their development of non-Newtonian calculus on 14 July 1967. Prior to that day, non-Newtonian calculus was unknown to them, and (apparently) to everyone else. In Non-Newtonian Calculus (1972), Grossman and Katz included the following paragraph (page 82):
”However, since we have nowhere seen a discussion of even one specific non-Newtonian calculus, and since we have not found a notion that encompasses the *-average, we are inclined to the view that the non-Newtonian calculi have not been known and recognized heretofore.

For studying the time evolution of such ”rough” objects, the classical, ”smooth” Newtonian calculus is not enough.” In an abstract to another seminar he asserted: ”Random fractals, a quintessentially 20th century idea, arise as natural models of various physical, biological (think your mother’s favorite cauliflower dish), and economic (think Wall Street, or the Horseshoe Casino) phenomena, and they can be characterized in terms of the mathematical concept of fractional dimension.

<p class="ltx_p">According to [21], ”in dimensional spaces (in a similar way to physical quantities) you can multiply and divide quantities which have different dimensions but you cannot add and subtract quantities with different dimensions. This means that the classical additive derivative is undefined because the difference f(x+deltax)-f(x) has no value. However in dimensional spaces, the geometric derivative and the bigeometric derivative remain well-defined. Multiplicative dynamical systems can become chaotic even when the corresponding classical additive system does not because the additive and multiplicative derivatives become inequivalent if the variables involved also have a varying fractal dimension.”

The geometric calculus was used by Luc Florack and Hans van Assen (both of the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands) in their work on biomedical image analysis and ”complex imaging frameworks such as diffusion tensor imaging”. In their article ”Multiplicative calculus in biomedical image analysis” [88], they assert: ”We advocate the use of an alternative calculus in biomedical image analysis, known as multiplicative (a.k.a. non-Newtonian) calculus. … The purpose of this article is to provide a condensed review of multiplicative calculus and to illustrate its potential use in biomedical image analysis. … Examples have been given in the context of cardiac strain analysis and diffusion tensor imaging to illustrate the relevance of multiplicative calculus in biomedical image analysis, and to support our recommendation for further investigation into practical as well as fundamental issues.” (The expression ”multiplicative calculus” refers here to the geometric calculus.) In Professor Florack’s article [96] he states: ”Multiplicative calculus provides a natural framework in problems involving positive images and positivity preserving operators. In increasingly important, complex imaging frameworks, such as diffusion tensor imaging, it complements standard calculus in a nontrivial way. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the basics of multiplicative calculus and its application to the regularization of positive definite matrix fields.” (The expression ”multiplicative calculus” refers here to the geometric calculus.)

Non-Newtonian models follow from non- Newtonian calculi. … Here are a few rules of thumb for non-Newtonian models. If a meta-model is primarily concerned with learning probabilities, non-parametric distributions, or anything else where the multiplication is the primary operation, then the geometric calculi may be of interest.

<p class="ltx_p">”Your ideas [in Non-Newtonian Calculus] seem quite ingenious.”
Â - Dirk J. Struik, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA; from his correspondence, dated 20 April 1972, with Grossman, Grossman, and Katz.
”The monographs on non-Newtonian calculus by [Grossman, Grossman, and Katz] appear to be very useful and innovative.”â¨Â - Kenneth J. Arrow, Nobel-Laureate, Stanford University, USA ; from his correspondence, dated 26 November 1980, with Grossman, Grossman, and Katz.
”There is enough here [in Non-Newtonian Calculus] to indicate that non-Newtonian calculi … have considerable potential as alternative approaches to traditional problems. This very original piece of mathematics will surely expose a number of missed opportunities in the history of the subject.”â¨Â  - Ivor Grattan-Guinness, Middlesex University, England; from his 1977 review of Non-Newtonian Calculus [101].
”Non-Newtonian Calculus, by Michael Grossman and Robert Katz, is a fascinating and (potentially) extremely important piece of mathematical theory. That a whole family of differential and integral calculi, parallel to but nonlinear with respect to ordinary Newtonian (or Leibnizian) calculus, should have remained undiscovered (or uninvented) for so long is astonishing – but true. Every mathematician and worker with mathematics owes it to himself to look into the discoveries of Grossman and Katz. The theory has proved to be most valuable in several research studies in which I am engaged. I predict that non-Newtonian calculus will come to be recognized as the most important mathematical discovery of the Twentieth Century.” â¨Â - James R. Meginniss, Claremont Graduate School and Harvey Mudd College, USA; from a 1980 memorandum to his colleagues.
”The purpose of this paper is to present a new theory of probability that is adapted to human behavior and decision making.”
- James R. Meginniss, Claremont Graduate School and Harvey Mudd College, USA; from his 1980 article ”Non-Newtonian calculus applied to probability, utility, and Bayesian analysis” [16].
”The possibilities opened up by the [non-Newtonian] calculi seem to be immense.”â¨Â - H. Gollmann, Graz, Austria; from his 1972 review of Non-Newtonian Calculus [53].
Â ”This [Non-Newtonian Calculus] is an exciting little book … The greatest value of these non-Newtonian calculi may prove to be their ability to yield simpler physical laws than the Newtonian calculus.

”Grossman and Katz [Non-Newtonian Calculus] mention several alternative calculi including: geometric, anageometric, bigeometric, quadratic, anaquadratic, biquadratic, harmonic, anaharmonic, and biharmonic. … Non-Newtonian calculus has been used to derive optimization algorithms that perform better than traditional Newton based methods for Expectation-Maximization algorithms. However, Non-Newtonian calculus goes beyond simply being useful for optimization, it is useful for the other half of learning: modeling. The second order approximation using geometric calculus may produce the Gaussian curve … . The nth order approximation using bigeometric calculus produces an nth polynomial on a log-log plot. … Non-Newtonian generalized Taylor expansions produce nth order models, which are rarely polynomials. … Non-Newtonian models sometimes make sense to use. Non-Newtonian models follow from non- Newtonian calculi. … Here are a few rules of thumb for non-Newtonian models. If a meta-model is primarily concerned with learning probabilities, non-parametric distributions, or anything else where the multiplication is the primary operation, then the geometric calculi may be of interest. If working in a domain where the squares are additive, as is common the case when estimating the variance of a sum of independent random variables, then the quadratic calculi may produce meaningful models.”

<p class="ltx_p">”In general the position as regards all such new calculi is this - That one cannot accomplish by them anything that could not be accomplished without them. However, the advantage is, that, provided such a calculus corresponds to the inmost nature of frequent needs, anyone who masters it thoroughly is able - without the unconscious inspiration of genius which no one can command - to solve the respective problems, indeed to solve them mechanically in complicated cases in which, without such aid, even genius becomes powerless. Such is the case with the invention of general algebra, with the differential calculus, and in a more limited region with Lagrange’s calculus of variations, with my calculus of congruences, and with Mobius’ calculus. Such conceptions unite, as it were, into an organic whole countless problems which otherwise would remain isolated and require for their separate solution more or less application of inventive genius.”

<p class="ltx_p">Â Â Â Â Â  ”But if some mind very different from ours were to look upon some property of some curved line as we do on the evenness of a straight line, he would not recognize as such the evenness of a straight line; nor would he arrange the elements of his geometry according to that very different system, and would investigate quite other relationships as I have suggested in my notes.
Â Â Â Â  ”We fashion our geometry on the properties of a straight line because that seems to us to be the simplest of all. But really all lines that are continuous and of a uniform nature are just as simple as one another. Another kind of mind which might form an equally clear mental perception of some property of any one of these curves, as we do of the congruence of a straight line, might believe these curves to be the simplest of all, and from that property of these curves build up the elements of a very different geometry, referring all other curves to that one, just as we compare them to a straight line. Indeed, these minds, if they noticed and formed an extremely clear perception of some property of, say, the parabola, would not seek, as our geometers do, toÂ rectifyÂ the parabola, they would endeavor, if one may coin the expression, toÂ parabolifyÂ the straight line.”

But for a long time it was not difficult to find professional research mathematicians who stoutly maintained that fractals and chaos were completely useless and that all of the interest in them was pure hype. This attitude persisted into the current century, when fractals had been around for at least twenty-five years and chaos for forty. That this attitude was narrow-minded and unimaginative is easy to establish, because by that time both areas were being routinely used in branches of science ranging from astrophysics to zoology.

<p class="ltx_p">My Response to Some Critics, by Michael Grossman</p>
</div>
<div id="p498" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It’s an interesting fact that in any given non-Newtonian calculus, the derivative and integral can be expressed in terms of the classical derivative and classical integral, respectively (Non-Newtonian Calculus [15], page 31). Unfortunately, some critics of non-Newtonian calculus have fallaciously argued that it follows from that fact that the non-Newtonian calculi are useless.</p>
</div>
<div id="p499" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Indeed, if that argument is valid, then each of the absurd arguments indicated below would also be valid:
The operation of multiplication of two positive integers is useless because of the fact that it can be expressed in terms of (repeated) addition.
The operation of multiplication of two positive numbers is useless because of the fact that it can be expressed in terms of addition (by using logarithms).
The operation of division of two positive numbers is useless because of the fact that it can be expressed in terms of subtraction (by using logarithms).Â 
The geometric average (of two positive numbers) is useless because of the fact that it can be expressed in terms of the arithmetic average (by using logarithms).
The logarithmic derivative is useless because of the fact that it can be expressed in terms of the classical derivative.
The elasticity concept (used in economics, etc.) is useless because of the fact that it can be expressed in terms of the classical derivative.
The classical calculus is useless because of the fact that the classical derivative and classical integral can each be expressed in the context of the real number system (e.g., by using ’epsilon-delta’ formulations).</p>
</div>
<div id="p500" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Interestingly enough, the great mathematician, astronomer, and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) discussed the usefulness of new calculi a long time ago:Â Â 
”In general the position as regards all such new calculi is this - That one cannot accomplish by them anything that could not be accomplished without them. However, the advantage is, that, provided such a calculus corresponds to the inmost nature of frequent needs, anyone who masters it thoroughly is able - without the unconscious inspiration of genius which no one can command - to solve the respective problems, indeed to solve them mechanically in complicated cases in which, without such aid, even genius becomes powerless. Such is the case with the invention of general algebra [and] with the differential calculus … . Such conceptions unite, as it were, into an organic whole countless problems which otherwise would remain isolated and require for their separate solution more or less application of inventive genius.”
Â - Carl Friedrich Gauss, as quoted in Carl Friedrich Gauss: Werke, Volume 8, page 298; and as quoted in Robert Edouard Moritz’sÂ  book Memorabilia Mathematica or The Philomath’s Quotation Book, quotation #1215 (1914).Â</p>
</div>
<div id="p501" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Finally, it’s worth noting that the classical derivative and classical integral can each be expressed in terms of the corresponding operator of any given non-Newtonian calculus. (Please see page 28 of The First Nonlinear System of Differential and Integral Calculus [11], and page 34 of Bigeometric Calculus: A System With a Scale-free Derivative [10].)

<p class="ltx_p">Recollections and Reflections, by Michael Grossman</p>
</div>
<div id="p506" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In this section I present some recollections and reflections about my participation in the creation and development of non-Newtonian calculus (NNC). I alone am responsible for the content. It’s been an amazing experience. Many memories still seem vivid. I recommend that you read the Brief History section of the website before continuing.</p>
</div>
<div id="p507" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Robert (Bob) Katz was one of my mathematics professors when I was a student at Tufts University (1960 to 1964). We eventually became good friends. Our common interests include mathematics, music, and hiking. While at Tufts, I assisted him in the writing of his textbook Axiomatic Analysis (D. C. Heath, 1964), and then in teaching from it. Axiomatic Analysis contains a simple, clear, and orderly treatment ofÂ  basic logic and the real number system, and provides students with important training in logical and creative thinking. Incidentally we were both graduate students at the Yale University mathematics department, although Bob preceded me by about twenty years.</p>
</div>
<div id="p508" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A remarkable person, Bob is brilliant, amazingly imaginative, hardworking, caring, and generous. He is a superb mathematics writer, and a magnificent teacher - the best teacher I ever had. I have been privileged to be his student, colleague, and friend.</p>
</div>
<div id="p509" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We began our work on NNC on 14 July 1967. We happened to come across a simple algebraic identity in a statistics book that led us to create the first non-Newtonian calculus, the geometric calculus. This is explained on page 85 of our book Non-Newtonian Calculus. Shortly afterwards, we created infinitely more, but not all, non-Newtonian calculi. We were thrilled!Â  We realized that the geometric calculus, and possibly many other non-Newtonian calculi, would be useful in science, engineering, and mathematics. The geometric calculus is well suited for use in many situations where multiplication/division, rather than addition/subtraction, are the most natural ways of combining/comparing numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="p510" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">By August of 1967, we had produced a table, which we called the CHART, on which we compared the concepts of the classical calculus with the corresponding concepts of the geometric calculus and the corresponding concepts of our most general (up to that time) non-Newtonian calculus. I have a vague memory of being in the back seat of Bob’s car, heading west on the Massachusetts Turnpike. I had a pad of paper and a pencil, and I was working on the CHART. Bob and his wonderful wife Rosalie were in the front seats. We were driving from their home in Boston to Poughkeepsie, New York, where they had some family matters to take care of. Bob and I thought it would be a good idea for me to accompany him so we could finish the CHART quickly. I must have been concentrating intensely on my work because I have no memory of the city of Poughkeepsie or the sights we passed during that trip.</p>
</div>
<div id="p511" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We decided to show the CHART to a distinguished Harvard mathematics professor. At that time Bob was a mathematics editor at a major publishing company based in Boston. The professor and Bob had met a few times when the professor was working with the company as a consultant on the famous SMSG mathematics project called ”The New Math”. They had both helped with Mary Dolciani’s textbooks for SMSG. Bob and I both lived near the professor’s home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. (I lived with my parents and sister Dotty in Somerville, Massachusetts.) We drove to his house. His wife told us he was not home, but that she would give the CHART to him. We thanked her, and drove away feeling cheerful. But unfortunately the professor never responded. We then showed the CHART to other pure mathematicians. But after a few months, it became clear that the CHART did not interest them.</p>
</div>
<div id="p512" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">So we tried another approach: writing a book that we called Dialogs on Non-Newtonian Calculus. We completed the book in August of 1968. It was a sequence of dialogs, written in the spirit of Galileo’s 1632 classic Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. Our book contained discussions between a student and a mathematician about the non-Newtonian calculi we had constructed in 1967. The dialog format enabled us to present the material in an informal way with lots of questions and answers. I remember hiking with Bob in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, to celebrate the completion of the book. But months later, the book had been rejected by all the publishers we had contacted.</p>
</div>
<div id="p513" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Finally, in 1969, we decided to write a book in the form of a research report. We called it Non-Newtonian Calculus. Interestingly, in August of 1970 while writing the book we unexpectedly created infinitely more non-Newtonian calculi, including the bigeometric calculus. (Roughly, we did this by transforming function values and arguments, not just values.) Again we were thrilled! We knew that the bigeometric calculus like the geometric calculus and maybe many other non-Newtonian calculi would be useful. In fact, just as the geometric calculus is well suited for use in certain situations where multiplication/division are naturally used, the bigeometric calculus is well suited for use in many other situations where multiplication/division are naturally used.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â</p>
</div>
<div id="p514" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Non-Newtonian Calculus was first published in 1972. It contains among other things discussions about nine specific non-Newtonian calculi, including the geometric and bigeometric calculi, and the general theory of non-Newtonian calculus. We published the book ourselves in order to maintain control of the contents. We tried to make the book readable for scientists and engineers, as well as for mathematicians. Well aware that people are reluctant to accept new ideas without good reasons, we worked hard to develop motivations and explanations for each concept. Included in the book are various ideas concerning potential applications, including a chapter with heuristic guides for choosing an appropriate calculus. We were determined to write the book clearly and concisely, and made a special effort to avoid mistakes.</p>
</div>
<div id="p515" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We distributed copies of Non-Newtonian Calculus to individual purchasers, to libraries, and to journals for review. We received enthusiastic encouragement from a few people. The response we received from Dirk J. Struik, the eminent historian and mathematician, was particularly pleasing.Â  We sent him a copy of Non-Newtonian Calculus in 1972. He graciously invited us to visit him at his home in Belmont, Massachusetts. Our visit was enjoyable and memorable. His deep historical perspective is uncommon among research mathematicians. (”Mathematicians are notoriously bad historians”, according to the mathematician Peter D. Lax. [282]) Professor Struik recognized NNC’s potential for application, and he asked us to keep him informed.
”Your ideas [in Non-Newtonian Calculus] seem quite ingenious.”
Â - Dirk J. Struik, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA; from his letter dated 20 April 1972.</p>
</div>
<div id="p516" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Cautiously optimistic, we patiently waited to see if anybody would discover some application(s) of NNC. But much to our dismay, it turned out that various pure mathematicians said NNC was useless. (Please see Appendix 1.) Some of them were rude and arrogant. It became discouraging.</p>
</div>
<div id="p517" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The negativity of some pure mathematicians toward NNC surprised us at first, but eventually we became painfully accustomed to it. In the beginning we were naively unaware that new and unusual ideas, even in science and mathematics, are often ignored, ridiculed, or demeaned by the academic establishment, even in the 20th and 21st centuries. This matter is perceptively discussed in the following two quotations, and in Scott Berkun’s The Myths of Innovation (O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2010), a book I wish Bob and I had read before we began our work on NNC.</p>
</div>
<div id="p518" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">”Some insights are resisted with such intensity that it may take decades before they’re widely accepted among scientists. For some, such as HIV, heliocentrism, and evolution, pockets of resistance remain decades or centuries after the war is won. … Are you ready to have the top scientists in your field criticizing your work in journals and dissing you at meetings? Because history shows that the deeper your idea cuts into the heart of a field, the more your peers are likely to challenge you. Human nature being what it is, what ought to be reasoned discussion may turn personal, even nasty. … Progress is made when good scientists keep working – and keep supporting what they believe is true – despite the criticism.”
Â - Anne Sasso; from her article ”Audacity, Part 5: Rejection and Ridicule” in the magazine Science (American Association for the Advancement of Science) (11 June 2010).</p>
</div>
<div id="p519" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">”Flying in the face of the Establishment with unconventional ideas and methods … is highly esteemed in academia –Â  until somebody actually does it.”
Â - Edward Tenner; from his article ”Benoit Mandelbrot the Maverick, 1924-2010” in The Atlantic magazine (16 October 2010).</p>
</div>
<div id="p520" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Jane Tang and I got married in 1972. She joined Bob and me in our work on NNC, and over a period of several years we came up with various new ideas, and wrote more books and some articles. We showed that the classical calculus and each non-Newtonian calculus can be ’weighted’ in a manner explained in our book The First Systems of Weighted Differential and Integral Calculus (1980). In each of these ’weighted calculi’ a weight function and a weighted average play a central role. We then created the ’meta-calculi’, in each of which two weight functions play a central role. The meta-calculi can be used for financial-investment analysis, and are discussed in our book Meta-Calculus: Differential and Integral (1981). Our book Averages: A New Approach (1983) includes a method we devised for using averages of functions to construct means of two positive numbers; and our article ”A new approach to means of two positive numbers” (1986) contains examples of how that method can be used to prove inequalities. Our article ”Which growth rate?” (1987) includes application of the geometric calculus to the study of growth and decay. That article provides reasons for using the geometric derivative for studying the growth of organisms. Our book The First Nonlinear System of Differential and Integral Calculus, published in 1979, contains a detailed treatment of the geometric calculus. (In that book, we used the expression ”exponential calculus” instead of ”geometric calculus”.) And our book Bigeometric Calculus: A System with a Scale-Free Derivative, published in 1983, contains a detailed treatment of the bigeometric calculus. Between 1972 and 1988, we wrote five books and several journal articles. These publications received some favorable responses, but also discouraging criticism from some pure mathematicians.</p>
</div>
<div id="p521" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">I don’t remember the exact date. It might have been in 1978, but in any case it was a beautiful spring day at Bob and Rosalie’s home in Rockport, Masachusetts, where they had lived since about 1969. Bob, Rosalie, Jane, and I met with the distinguished English mathematics-historian Ivor Grattan-Guinness and Professor Thomas Hawkins, his colleague from Boston University, where Professor Grattan-Guinness had come to deliver a lecture. It was an interesting and enjoyable meeting. Professor Grattan-Guinness was good-natured, extremely knowledgeable, and obviously interested in NNC. He was impressed by the potential and originality of our work. Here’s an excerpt from his 1977 review of Non-Newtonian Calculus:
”There is enough here [in Non-Newtonian Calculus] to indicate that non-Newtonian calculi … have considerable potential as alternative approaches to traditional problems. This very original piece of mathematics will surely expose a number of missed opportunities in the history of the subject.”
Ivor Grattan-Guinness, Middlesex University, England; from his review of Non-Newtonian Calculus in Middlesex Math Notes, Middlesex University, London, England, Volume 3, pages 47 - 50, 1977.</p>
</div>
<div id="p522" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">An interesting application of NNC was made in 1980 by James R. Meginniss, an econometric specialist at the Claremont Graduate School and Harvey Mudd College. In his article ”Non-Newtonian calculus applied to probability, utility, and Bayesian analysis”, Professor Meginniss presented ”a new theory of probability that is adapted to human behavior and decision making”. In May of 1980, Bob and I met Professor Meginniss at Purdue University in Indiana when he presented his article to the American Statistical Association. He told us he had learned about NNC from one of his students who found a copy of Non-Newtonian Calculus in their school library and realized that NNC could be used in Professor Meginniss’ research.</p>
</div>
<div id="p523" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">For me, one of the most difficult aspects of the NNC project was making sure that we made no mistakes. I had worked hard on the proofs, and then I checked them and rechecked them to make sure they were correct. Even after our last publication, I continued to check the proofs. The books had been reviewed, and undoubtedly examined carefully, by first-rate mathematicians, and no errors were found. And yet, for years I was plagued with doubt. I couldn’t convince myself that there was nothing wrong with our work.</p>
</div>
<div id="p524" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">”Mathematicians are notoriously difficult to convince.”
Â - John Stuart Mill, as quoted in Robert Katz’s book Axiomatic Analysis (1964).
</p>
</div>
<div id="p525" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">” Proofs should be treated with skepticism until mathematicians have had a chance to review them thoroughly, Yau [Shing-Tung Yau] told us. Until then, he said, ’itâs not mathâitâs religion.’â
- Sylvia Nasar and David Gruber, from their article ”Manifold destiny” in the The New Yorker magazine, 28 August 2006.</p>
</div>
<div id="p526" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">But ironically it turned out that there was something wrong with me: obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). By the spring of 1988, my checking and rechecking had become all-consuming. It resulted in anxiety and depression, so bad that I could not function normally. That’s when a psychiatrist diagnosed me with OCD. It was the first time I had ever heard of OCD, which is an anxiety disorder. Some OCD patients compulsively wash their hands, disturbed that their hands might be dirty and unable to ever convince themselves that their hand-washing was effective. Other patients compulsively check their door locks, unable to ever convince themselves that their doors are locked and their houses are safe. In my case the obsession is mathematics, and the compulsion is checking my NNC notes to make sure that all the proofs are valid. In any case, no matter what the obsession/compulsion, OCD is torturous and extremely depressing.</p>
</div>
<div id="p527" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">”Obsessive-compulsive disorder can make people do weird things. The mathematician Kurt GÃ¶del was so afraid of tainted food that he would eat only portions his wife tasted first; after she became too ill to do this, he starved to death. The inventor Nikola Tesla spent the last 10 years of his life living in a hotel, eating at precisely 8 oâclock every evening, always using a stack of exactly 18 linen napkins to clean his cutlery; he felt compelled to walk around the block three times before entering his laboratory, and he was so afraid of germs that he would not allow his friends near him. My favorite anecdote from the book [The Man Who Couldnât Stop: OCD and the True Story of a Life Lost in Thought]: A Canadian man whose OCD was so unbearable that he attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head â but succeeded only in lobotomizing himself in such a way that he was cured.”
Â - Scott Stossel, from his review in The New York Times newspaper (30 January 2015) of David Adam’s book The Man Who Couldnât Stop: OCD and the True Story of a Life Lost in Thought.</p>
</div>
<div id="p528" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Many months of behavior therapy with an excellent psychologist, and a daily dose of antidepressant medicine, prescribed by excellent psychiatrists, have enabled me to recover enough to lead a normal life - except that I can not do mathematics anymore. Jane and I gave up our positions in the mathematics department at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and moved to Florida. Jane taught herself investing during the many extended periods when I was busy checking my NNC notes; and as a result of her wise investment decisions, we now have a comfortable life.</p>
</div>
<div id="p529" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Bob didn’t understand my condition, and became frustrated when his well-intentioned suggestions failed to help me. On 19 October 1989, Bob sent me a letter indicating that he felt it would be best for both of us if we suspended our friendship.</p>
</div>
<div id="p530" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The support I received from my wife Jane Tang Grossman, my parents Ruth and Milton Grossman, my sisters Linda Meier and Dorothy Lukas, and the Grossman and Tang families gave me reason to try hard to recover from my OCD, a seemingly bottomless pit. Anxiety and depression are extraordinarily difficult to combat. Depression is not the same as sadness. It’s far worse. My psychiatrists and psychologist have been invaluable. Without them I would not have recovered as much as I have, if at all. I am deeply grateful to Drs. Morton Miller, Patricia Tahan, and Jeanne Yetz for their skill, guidance, and patience.</p>
</div>
<div id="p531" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Jane and I have been living in Jupiter, Florida, since 1990. We enjoy the beaches. And we enjoy the freedom to pursue our interests.

<p class="ltx_p">In 2003, my nephews David Lukas and Kenneth Lukas urged me to take what turned out to be a pivotal step: using the Internet to broadcast information about NNC. Dave is a computer engineer. Ken, a talented musician, uses the computer to compose music and to create videos and movies. They knew that posting information on the Internet would be an excellent way to inform people about NNC. On 2 April 2003, Dave set up the first NNC website. Later, on 28 September 2003, I set up another NNC website. I also made all six of our books on NNC and related matters available to be read and downloaded, free of charge, at HathiTrust, Google Books, and the Digital Public Library of America; and I made the books available for purchase at booksellers such as Amazon.com. … As a result researchers who previously knew nothing about our work have found applications of NNC in many fields!</p>

<p class="ltx_p">For the past several years, I’ve been loading lots of information onto the Internet regarding our work on non-Newtonian calculus (NNC) and related matters. This effort has turned out to be worthwhile, because lately, there have been far more applications of NNC than ever before. Apparently some people have seen the stuff I’ve put on the Internet, and have found it useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="p560" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">One of the most exciting areas of NNC application is fractal geometry, a subject created in the 1970s by Benoit Mandelbrot, a brilliant maverick mathematician/scientist whose work was, like ours, at first dismissed as pointless. Now fractal geometry is being used practically everywhere, e.g., inÂ  biology, chemistry, physics, economics, engineering, psychology, physiology, and medicine. Fractal geometry, unlike Euclidean geometry, is concerned with roughness. In fact, fractal geometry is a new mathematical tool for investigating roughness.</p>
</div>
<div id="p561" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Here’s where NNC comes in. I’ve learned from various sources on the Internet that the bigeometric calculus is being used in fractal geometry. In fact, the bigeometric derivative is now used to analyze the rate of change of the roughness of a fractal over time.</p>
