\begin{document}
Oftentimes, one needs to estimate differences of powers of real numbers.
The following inequalities are useful for this purpose:
\[ n (u-v) v^{n-1} < u^n - v^n < n (u-v) u^{n-1} \]
\[ n x \le (1 + x)^n - 1 \]
\[ (1 + x)^n - 1 \le { n x \over 1 - (n - 1) x} \]

Here $n$ is an integer greater than 1.
The first inequality holds when $0 < v < u$, the second inequality holds
when $-1 < x $, and the third inequality holds when $-1 < x < 1/(n-1)$.
Equality can only occur in the latter two inequalities when $x = 0$.
