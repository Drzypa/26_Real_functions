We prove an equivalent, more convenient formulation:  Let $X$ be some random variable, and let $f(x)$ be a convex function (defined at least on a segment containing the range of $X$).  Then the expected value of $f(X)$ is at least the value of $f$ at the mean of $X$:
$$
\Expect[f(X)] \ge f(\Expect [X]).
$$

Indeed, let $c=\Expect [X]$.  Since $f(x)$ is convex, there exists a supporting line for $f(x)$ at $c$:
$$
\varphi(x)=\alpha (x-c) + f(c)
$$
for some $\alpha$, and $\varphi(x)\le f(x)$.  Then
$$
\Expect[f(X)] \ge \Expect[\varphi(X)] = \Expect[\alpha (X-c) + f(c)] = f(c)
$$
as claimed.
