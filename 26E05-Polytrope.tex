\paragraph{Mathematical concept}
Let $n$ be a nonnegative constant.\, A 
\emph{polytropic equation} expresses that the real variable 
$y$ is inversely proportional to the power $x^n$ of the real 
variable $x$.\, So, it is a question of the equation
\begin{align}
y \;=\; \frac{c}{x^n}
\end{align}
where $c$ is another constant.

The graph of a polytropic equation is called a 
\emph{polytrope}.\, It has the coordinate axes as asymptotes 
for\, $n \neq 0$.\, Special cases of polytrope are the 
hyperbola \,$y = \frac{c}{x}$\, and the 
\emph{cubic hyperbola}
$$y = \frac{c}{x^2}.$$\\

Below one sees the \PMlinkescapetext{right} halves of three polytropes given by the integer $n$ values 0 (green), 1 (cyan) and 2 (blue); farther below a whole cubic hyperbola.

\paragraph{An application to thermodynamics: The reversible polytropic process}
When a gas undergoes a reversible process in which there is heat transfer, the process frequently takes place in such a manner that a plot of $\log{p}$ vs. $\log{v}$ is a straight line. Here $p$ denotes absolute pressure (e.g. in psia) and $v$ specific volume (e.g. in $ft^3/lbm$).  For such a process
$$pv^n = \mbox{constant}.$$
This is called a \emph{polytropic process}.  Indeed this equation represents a \emph{constitutive equation} since it can be verifiable experimentally in a lab for different processes of heat transfer, i.e. for distinct rational values of $n$. It is obvious, from the above equation, that
$$\frac{d \log{p}}{d \log{v}} = -n,$$
where $-n$ is the slope of the straight line on the mentioned logarithmic chart. Typical polytropic processes are tabulated as follow. \\

Legend:\, $p$ $=$ abs. pressure;\, $T$ $=$ abs. temperature;\, $s$ $=$ specific entropy;\, $v$ $=$ specific volume \\


In general, one may have more complex processes of heat transfer where $n$ is any rational number (e.g.\, $n = -2,\,-1,\, -0.5$, etc.). \,Specific examples are the expansion of the combustion gases in the cylinders of water-cooled internal combustion engines and reciprocating machines. \,In such cases the pressure and volume during a polytropic process are measured, as might be done with an \emph{engine indicator}, so that the logarithm of the pressure and volume are plotted in \PMlinkescapetext{order} to know the \emph{polytropic constant} $n$.  \\
