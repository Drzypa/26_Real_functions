\begin{document}
A {\it normal line} (or simply {\it normal} or {\it perpendicular}) of a curve at one of its points $P$ is the line passing through this point and perpendicular to the tangent line of the curve at $P$.\, The point $P$ is the {\it foot} of the normal.

If the plane curve\, $y = f(x)$\, has a skew tangent at the point\, $(x_0,\,f(x_0))$,\, then the slope of the tangent at that point is\, $f'(x_0)$\, and the slope of the normal at that point is\, $\displaystyle -\frac{1}{f'(x_0)}$.\, The equation of the normal is thus
             $$y-f(x_0) = -\frac{1}{f'(x_0)}(x-x_0).$$
In the case that the tangent is horizontal, the equation of the vertical normal is
                           $$x = x_0,$$
and in the case that the tangent is vertical, the equation of the normal is
                           $$y = f(x_0).$$  

The normal of a curve at its point $P$ always goes through the center of curvature belonging to the point $P$.

In the picture below, the black curve is a parabola, the red line is the tangent at the point $P$, and the blue line is the normal at the point $P$.
