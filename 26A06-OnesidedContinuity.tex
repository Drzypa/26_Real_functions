\begin{document}
The real function $f$ is {\em continuous from the left} in the point\, $x = x_0$\, iff
$$\lim_{x\to x_0-}f(x) = f(x_0).$$

The real function $f$ is {\em continuous from the right} in the point\, $x = x_0$\, iff
$$\lim_{x\to x_0+}f(x) = f(x_0).$$

The real function $f$ is {\em continuous on the closed interval} \,$[a,\,b]$\, iff it is continuous at all points of the open interval \,$(a,\,b)$,\, from the right continuous at $a$ and from the left continuous at $b$.\\


\textbf{Examples.}\, The ceiling function $\lceil{x}\rceil$ is from the left continuous at each integer, the mantissa function $x\!-\!\lfloor{x}\rfloor$ is from the right continuous at each integer.
