\PMlinkescapeword{even}

\emph{Torricelli's trumpet} is a fictional infinitely long solid of revolution formed when the closed domain
\[
  A := \{(x,\,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2\,\vdots\;\; x \ge 1,\; 0 \le y \le \frac{1}{x}\}
\]
rotates about the $x$-axis.  It has a finite volume, $\pi$ volume
\PMlinkescapetext{units}, but the area of its surface is infinite; in
fact even the area of $A$ is infinite, i.e., the improper integral
$\displaystyle\int_1^\infty\frac{1}{x}\,dx$ is not convergent.

Torricelli's trumpet is surprising since it can be filled by a finite
amount of paint, but this paint can never suffice for painting its
surface, no matter how \PMlinkescapetext{thin} a coat of paint is
used!
