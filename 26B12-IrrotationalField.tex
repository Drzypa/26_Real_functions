Suppose $\Omega$ is an open set in $\sR^3$, and $\bV$ is a vector field
with differentiable real (or possibly complex) valued component functions.
If $\nabla\times \bV=0$, then $\bV$ is called an {\bf irrotional vector field},
or {\bf curl free field}.

If $\bU$ and $\bV$ are irrotational, then $\bU\times\bV$ is solenoidal.
