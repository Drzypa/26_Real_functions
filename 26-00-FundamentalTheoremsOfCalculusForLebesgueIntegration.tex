\begin{document}
Loosely, the \emph{Fundamental Theorems of Calculus} serve to demonstrate that integration and differentiation are inverse processes.  Suppose that $F(x)$ is an absolutely continuous function on an interval $[a,b]\subset\mathbb{R}$.  The two following forms of the theorem are equivalent.

{\bf First form of the Fundamental Theorem:}

There exists a function $f(t)$ Lebesgue-integrable on $[a,b]$ such that for any $x\in [a,b]$, we have $F(x)-F(a)=\int_a^x f(t) dt$.

{\bf Second form of the Fundamental Theorem:}

$F(x)$ is differentiable almost everywhere on $[a,b]$ and its derivative, denoted $F'(x)$, is Lebesgue-integrable on that interval.  In addition, we have the relation $F(x)-F(a)=\int_a^x F'(t)dt$ for any $x\in [a,b]$.
