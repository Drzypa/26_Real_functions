The sequence 
\begin{align}
a_0,a_1,a_2, \ldots
\end{align}
in a metric space $(X, d)$ is called {\it contractive}, iff there is a real number 
$r \in (0,1)$ such that for any positive integer $n$ the inequality
\begin{align}
d(a_n, a_{n+1}) \leqq r\!\cdot\!d(a_{n-1}, a_n)
\end{align}
is true.    \\

We will prove the 

\textbf{Theorem.}\, If the sequence (1) is contractive, it is 
a Cauchy sequence.

{\it Proof.}\, Suppose that the sequence (1) is 
contractive.  Let $\varepsilon$ be an arbitrary positive number and 
$m, n$ some positive integers from which e.g. $n$ is greater than
$m,$ $n = m+\delta$.

Using repeatedly the triangle inequality we get
\begin{align*}
d(a_m, a_n) &\leqq d(a_m, a_{m+1})+d(a_{m+1}, a_{m+\delta})\\
            &\leqq d(a_m, a_{m+1})+d(a_{m+1}, a_{m+2})+d(a_{m+2}, a_{m+\delta})\\
            & \ldots\\
            &\leqq d(a_m, a_{m+1})+d(a_{m+1}, a_{m+2})+
            d(a_{m+2}, a_{m+3})+\ldots+d(a_{n-1}, a_n).           

\end{align*}

Now the contractiveness gives the inequalities
$$d(a_1, a_2) \leqq rd(a_0, a_1),$$
$$d(a_2, a_3) \leqq rd(a_1, a_2) \leqq r^2d(a_0, a_1),$$
$$d(a_3, a_4) \leqq rd(a_2, a_3) \leqq r^3d(a_0, a_1),$$
$$\ldots$$
$$d(a_m, a_{m+1}) \leqq r^md(a_0, a_1),$$
$$\ldots$$
$$d(a_{n-1}, a_n}) \leqq r^{n-1}d(a_0, a_1),$$
by which we obtain the estimation
\begin{align*}
d(a_m, a_n) &\leqq d(a_0, a_1)(r^m+r^{m+1}+\ldots+r^{m+\delta-1})\\
  & = d(a_0, a_1)r^m(1+r+r^2+\ldots+r^{\delta-1})\\
  & = d(a_0, a_1)r^m\frac{1-r^\delta}{1-r}\\
  & < d(a_0, a_1)\frac{r^m}{1-r}.
\end{align*}
The last expression tends to zero as $m \to \infty$.\, Thus 
there exists a positive number $M$ such that  
$$d(a_m, a_n) < \varepsilon \mbox{  for each } m > M$$
when $n > m$.\, Consequently, (1) is a Cauchy sequence.\\

\textbf{Remark.}\; The assertion of the Theorem cannot be 
reversed.  E.g. in the usual metric of $\mathbb{R}$, the 
sequence\, $1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\ldots$\, converges to 0 
and hence is Cauchy, but for it the ratio
$$|a_n-a_{n+1}|:|a_{n-1}-a_n}| \;=\; 1-\frac{2}{n+1}$$
tends to 1 as\, $n \to \infty$.\\
