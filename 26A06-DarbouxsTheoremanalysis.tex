\begin{document}
Let $f:[a,b]\to\Reals$ be a real-valued continuous function on $[a,b]$, which is differentiable on $(a,b)$, differentiable from the right at $a$, and differentiable from the left at $b$.  Then $f'$ \PMlinkescapetext{satisfies} the intermediate value theorem: for every $t$ between $f'_{+}(a)$ and $f'_{-}(b)$, there is some $x\in [a,b]$ such that $f'(x)=t$.

Note that when $f$ is continuously differentiable ($f\in C^1([a,b])$), this is trivially true \emph{by} the intermediate value theorem.  But even when $f'$ is \emph{not} continuous, Darboux's theorem places a severe restriction on what it can be.
