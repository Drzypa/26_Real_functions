To prove that
$$ \frac{2}{\pi}x\leq\sin(x)\leq x, \forall\;x\in [0,\frac{\pi}{2}] $$

consider a \PMlinkescapetext{unit} circle (circle with radius = 1 \PMlinkescapetext{unit}). Take any point $P$ on the circumference of the circle.

Drop the perpendicular from $P$ to the horizontal line, $M$ being the foot of the perpendicular and $Q$ the reflection of $P$ at $M$.
(refer to figure)

Let $x = \angle POM.$

For $x$ to be in $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$, the point $P$ lies in the first quadrant, as shown.

\end{center}

The length of line segment $PM$ is $\sin(x)$.
Construct a circle of radius $MP$, with $M$ as the center.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{jord2.eps}
\end{center}

Length of line segment $PQ$ is $2\sin(x)$.

Length of arc $PAQ$ is $2x$.

Length of arc $PBQ$ is $\pi\sin(x)$.

Since $PQ \leq$ length of arc $PAQ$ (equality holds when $x = 0$)                                          
we have $2\sin(x) \leq 2x$.                                                                                  
This implies  $$\sin(x) \leq x$$

Since length of arc $PAQ$ is $\leq $ length of arc $PBQ$ (equality holds true when $x = 0$ or $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$),
we have $2x \leq \pi\sin(x)$.                                                                           
This implies $$\frac{2}{\pi}x \leq \sin(x)$$

Thus we have 
$$ \frac{2}{\pi}x\leq\sin(x)\leq x,   \forall\;x\in [0,\frac{\pi}{2}] $$
