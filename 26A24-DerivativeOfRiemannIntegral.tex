\begin{document}
Let $f$ be a continuous function from an open subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$.\, Suppose that also the partial derivative\, $f'_t(x,\,t)$\, is continuous in $A$ which contains the line segments along which the integration is performed and that $a(t)$ and $b(t)$ are real functions differentiable in some point $t_0$.\, Denote
$$F(t) = \int_{a(t)}^{b(t)}f(x,\,t)\,dx$$
and 
$$G(t) = b'(t_0)\cdot f(b(t),\,t)-a'(t_0)\cdot f(a(t),\,t)
            +\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)}f'_t(x,\,t)\,dx.$$
Then one has the derivative
$$F'(t_0) = G(t_0)$$
in all such points\, $t = t_0$.
