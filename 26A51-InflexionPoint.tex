In examining the graphs of differentiable real functions, it may be useful to \PMlinkescapetext{state} the intervals where the function is \PMlinkescapetext{convex} and the ones where it is \PMlinkescapetext{concave}.  

\begin{itemize}

\item A function $f$ is said to be \PMlinkescapetext{{\em convex} on an interval} if the \PMlinkname{restriction}{RestrictionOfAFunction} of $f$ to this interval is a (strictly) convex function; this may be characterized more illustratively by saying that the graph of $f$ is \PMlinkescapetext{{\em concave upwards}} or \PMlinkescapetext{\emph{concave up}}.  On such an interval, the tangent line of the graph is constantly turning counterclockwise, \PMlinkname{i.e.}{Ie}, the derivative $f'$ is increasing and thus the second derivative $f''$ is positive.  In the picture below, the sine curve is concave up on the interval\, $(-\pi,\,0)$.

\item The {\em concavity} of the function $f$ on an interval correspondingly:  On such an interval, the graph of $f$ is \PMlinkescapetext{{\em concave downwards}} or \PMlinkescapetext{\emph{concave down}}, the tangent line turns clockwise, $f'$ decreases, and $f''$ is negative.  In the picture below, the sine curve is concave down on the interval\, $(0,\,\pi)$.

\item The points in which a function changes from \PMlinkescapetext{concave to convex} or vice versa are the {\em inflexion points} (or \emph{inflection points}) of the graph of the function.  At an inflexion point, the tangent line crosses the curve, the second derivative vanishes and changes its sign when one passes through the point.

\item A graph may have points where the second derivative vanishes but does not change its sign when passed such a point; thus the first derivative is here changing ``very slowly''.\, Such a point is sometimes called an {\it undulation point}.\, The graph of\, $x\mapsto x^4$\, has the origin as an undulation point.
\end{itemize}

\begin{pspicture}(-5,-2.5)(5,2)
\psaxes[Dx=9,Dy=1]{->}(0,0)(-4.5,-1.5)(5,2)
\rput(5,-0.2){$x$}
\rput(0.2,2){$y$}
\rput(3,-0.2){$\pi$}
\rput(-3.1,-0.2){$-\pi$}
\psplot[linecolor=blue]{-4}{4}{x 60 mul sin}
\psdot[linecolor=red](0,0)
\rput(0.2,-2.3){The origin is an inflexion point of the sinusoid \,$y = \sin{x}$.}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

Since the sine function is $2\pi$-periodic, the sinusoid possesses infinitely many inflexion points.  Indeed,\, 
$f(x) = \sin x$;\, $f''(x) = -\sin x = 0$\, for\, $x = 0,\,\pm\pi,\,\pm2\pi,\,\dots$;\, $f'''(x) = -\cos x$, $f'''(n\pi) = -\cos n\pi = (-1)^{n+1} \neq 0$.  Non-nullity of the third derivative at these critical points assures us the existence of those inflexion points.

\textbf{Remarks}

1.  For finding the inflexion points of the graph of $f$ it does not suffice to find the \PMlinkname{roots}{Equation} of the equation\, $f''(x) = 0$, since the sign of $f''$ does not necessarily change as one passes such a \PMlinkescapetext{root}.  If the second derivative maintains its sign when one of its zeros is passed, we can speak of a {\em plain point} (?) of the graph.  E.g. the origin is a plain point of the graph of\, $x\mapsto x^4$.

2.  Recalling that the \PMlinkname{curvature}{CurvaturePlaneCurve} $\kappa$ for a plane curve \,$y = f(x)$\, is given by
$$\kappa(x) \;=\; \frac{f''(x)}{[1+f'(x)^2]^{3/2}},$$
we can say that the inflexion points are the points of the curve where the curvature changes its sign and where the curvature equals zero.

3.  If an inflexion point\, $x = \xi$\, satisfies the additional condition \,$f'(\xi) = 0$,\, the point is said to be a \PMlinkescapetext{{\em stationary inflexion point}} or a {\em saddle-point}, while in the case\, $f'(\xi) \neq 0$\, it is a {\em non-stationary inflexion point}.
