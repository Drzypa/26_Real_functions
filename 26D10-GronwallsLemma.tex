\begin{document}
If, for $t_0\leq t\leq t_1$, $\phi(t)\geq 0$ and $\psi(t)\geq 0$ are continuous functions such that the inequality
\[
\phi(t)\leq K+L\int_{t_0}^t \psi(s)\phi(s)ds
\]
holds on $t_0\leq t\leq t_1$, with $K$ and $L$ positive constants, then
\[
\phi(t)\leq K\exp\left(L\int_{t_0}^t \psi(s)ds\right)
\]
on $t_0\leq t\leq t_1$.
