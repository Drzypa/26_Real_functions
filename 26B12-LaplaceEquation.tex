\begin{document}
The scalar form of \emph{Laplace's equation} is the partial differential equation $$\vnabla^2f = 0$$ and the vector form is $$\vnabla^2\vA = 0,$$where $\vnabla^2$ is the Laplacian. It is a special case of the Helmholtz differential equation with $k = 0.$

A function $f$ which satisfies Laplace's equation is said to be \emph{harmonic}. Since Laplace's equation is linear, the superposition of any two solutions is also a solution.
