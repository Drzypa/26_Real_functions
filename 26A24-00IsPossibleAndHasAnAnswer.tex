So, I am happy to tell you that I have solved 0/0 by means of utilizing set theory.
Set Theory is a part of math dealing with sets of objects.
We all know that 
1*0=0
2*0=0
...
30000*0=0
So that means that
Since P(R) is the whole set of real numbers
P(R)*0=0
Meaning to say, 0 divided by 0 is R, or the entire set of real numbers.
That is my solution to this mysterious expression that was yet to be solved.
