\begin{document}
Let 
$$F(x)=\int_0^x \phi(t)dt, \text{   and   } G(x)=\int_0^x \phi^{-1}(t)dt.$$
Since $\phi^{-1}$ is strictly increasing, $G$ is strictly convex, hence lies above its supporting line, i.e. for every $c$ and $x\neq c$
$$G(b)> G(c)+G'(c)(b-c)=G(c)+ \phi^{-1}(c)(b-c).$$
In particular, for $c=\phi(a)$ we have
$$F(a)+G(b)>F(a)+G(\phi(a))+a(b-\phi(a))=ab,$$
because $F(a)+G(\phi(a))=a\phi(a)$.
