\begin{document}
The \emph{quotient rule} says that the derivative of the quotient \(f/g\) of two differentiable functions \(f\) and \(g\) exists at all values of \(x\) as long as \(g(x) \not= 0\) and is given by the formula

\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}\ \left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\ \right] = 
\frac{g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{\lbrack g(x) \rbrack ^2} 
\end{equation*}


The Quotient Rule and the other differentiation formulas allow us to compute the derivative of any rational function.
