\textbf{Exercise~5.20} \\
\begin{itemize}
\item[(\textit{a})]
Does there exist a sequence of continuous positive functions \(f_n\)
on \(\mathbb{R}^1\) such that \(\{f_n(x)\}\) is unbounded if and only
if $x$ is rational?

\item[(\textit{b})]
Replace ``rational'' by irrational in (\textit{a}) and answer the resulting
question.

\item[(\textit{c})]
Replace ``\(\{f_n(x)\}\) is unbounded''
by ``\(f_n(x)\to \infty\) as \(n\to\infty\)''
and answer the resulting analogues of (\textit{a}) and (\textit{b}).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Solution}:
The answer to (\textit{a}) is negative.
This by showing that 
the subset of points where such sequence is unbounded must be \(G_\delta\).
But the rationals cannot be such, 
since in \(\mathbb{R}\) dense \(G_\delta\) sets must be of second category.
