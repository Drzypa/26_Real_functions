We will prove
\begin{equation}\label{3}
    \displaystyle
    \frac{f(t)-f(s)}{t-s}\leq\frac{f(u)-f(s)}{u-s}.
\end{equation}
The proof of the right-most inequality is similar.

Suppose (\ref{3}) does not hold. Then for some $s, t, u$,
\begin{equation}\label{2}
    \displaystyle
    \frac{f(t)-f(s)}{t-s}>\frac{f(u)-f(s)}{u-s}.
\end{equation}
This inequality is just the statement of the slope of the line
segment $\overline{AB}, A=(t, f(t)), B=(s, f(s))$, being larger than
the slope of the segment $\overline{CB}, C=(u, f(u))$. Since $t$ is
between $s$ and $u$, and $f$ is continuous, this implies
\begin{equation}
    f(t)>h(x)=\frac{f(u)-f(s)}{u-s}(x-s)+f(s),
\end{equation}
$s<x<u$. This contradicts convexity of $f$ on $(a, b)$. Hence,
(\ref{2}) is false and (\ref{3}) follows.

Note that we have tacitly use the fact that $x=\lambda u + (1-\lambda)s$ and $h(x)=\lambda
f(u)+(1-\lambda)f(s)$ for some $\lambda$.
