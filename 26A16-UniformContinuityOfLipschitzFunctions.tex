\begin{proposition}
An H\"o{}lder continuous mapping is uniformly continuous.
In particular any Lipschitz continuous mapping is uniformly continuous.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a mapping such that for some $C>0$ and $\alpha$ with $0 < \alpha \le 1$ one
has
\[
  d_Y(f(p),f(q)) \le C d_X(p,q)^\alpha.
\]
For every given $\epsilon > 0$, choose
$\delta=\left(\epsilon/(C+1)\right)^{\frac 1 \alpha}$.
If $p,q\in X$ are given points satisfying
\[
d_X(p,q)<\delta
\]
then
\[
d_Y(f(p),f(q))\leq C \delta^\alpha \le C\frac{\epsilon}{C+1} < \epsilon,
\]
as desired.
