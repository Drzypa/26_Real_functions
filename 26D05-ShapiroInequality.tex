\begin{document}
Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ be positive reals.
If $n$ is even and $n \leq 12$, or $n$ is odd and $n \leq 23$, then
$$\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{x_{i+1}+x_{i+2}} \geq \frac{n}{2},$$
where the subscripts are to be understood modulo $n$.

The particular case of $n=3$ is also known as Nesbitts inequality.
