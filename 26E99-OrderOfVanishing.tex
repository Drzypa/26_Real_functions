\textbf{Definition.}\, Let $x_0$ be a \PMlinkname{zero}{ZeroOfAFunction} of the real function $\Delta$.\, The {\em order of vanishing} of $\Delta$ at $x_0$ is $n$, if\, $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{\Delta(x)}{x^n}$ has a non-zero finite value.

Usually, $x_0$ of the definition is 0.\\

\textbf{Example.}\, If the curves \, $y = f(x)$\, and\, $y = g(x)$\, have in the point \,$(x_0,\,y_0)$\, the order of contact $n$, then the difference \, $\Delta(h) := g(x_0+h)-f(x_0+h)$\, of the ordinates has $n\!+\!1$-order of vanishing.
