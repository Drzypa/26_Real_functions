A real function $R(x)$ of a single variable $x$ is called
\emph{\PMlinkescapetext{rational}} if it can be written as a quotient
\[ R(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}, \]
where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials in $x$ with real coefficients. When one is only interested in algebraic properties of $R(x)$ or $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$, it is convenient to forget that they define functions and simply treat them as algebraic expressions in $x$. In this case $R(x)$ is referred to as a \emph{rational expression}.

In general, a rational function (expression) $R(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ has the form
\[ R(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)}{Q(x_1,\ldots,x_n)}, \]
where $P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ and $Q(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ are polynomials in the
variables $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ with coefficients in some field or
ring $S$.

In this sense, $R(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ can be regarded as an element of the fraction
field $S(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ of the polynomial ring $S[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
