\begin{document}
The mean-value theorem for a function of one real variable may be generalised for functions of arbitrarily many real variables; for the sake of concreteness, we here formulate it for the case of three variables:\\


\textbf{Theorem.}\, If a function \,$f(x,\,y,\,z)$\, is continuously differentiable in an open set of 
$\mathbb{R}^3$ containing the points \,$(x_1,\,y_1,\,z_1)$\, and \,$(x_2,\,y_2,\,z_2)$\, and the line segment connecting them, then an equation
$$f(x_2,\,y_2,\,z_2)-f(x_1,\,y_1,\,z_1) \;=\; 
f'_x(a,\,b,\,c)(x_2\!-\!x_1)+f'_y(a,\,b,\,c)(y_2\!-\!y_1)+f'_z(a,\,b,\,c)(z_2\!-\!z_1),$$
where $(a,\,b,\,c)$ an interior point of the line segment, is \PMlinkescapetext{valid}.\\
