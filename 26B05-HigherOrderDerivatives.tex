\PMlinkescapeword{order} 

Let the real function $f$ be defined and differentiable on the open interval $I$.\, Then for every\, $x \in I$,\, there exists the value $f'(x)$ as a certain real number.\, This means that we have a new function
\begin{align}
x \mapsto f'(x),
\end{align}
the so-called {\em derivative function} of $f$; it is denoted by 
$$f':\, I\to \mathbb{R}$$
or simply $f'$.

Forming the derivative function of a function is called {\em differentiation}, the corresponding verb is {\em differentiate}.

If the derivative function $f'$ is differentiable on $I$, then we have again a new function, the derivative function of the derivative function of $f$, which is denoted by $f''$.\, Then $f$ is said to be \emph{twice differentiable}.\, Formally,
$$f''(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x)}{h}\quad \mathrm{for\,all\,}\,x\in I.$$
The function\, $x\mapsto f''(x)$\, is called the \PMlinkescapetext{{\em second order derivative}} or {\em the second derivative} of $f$.\, Similarly, one can call (1) the \PMlinkescapetext{{\em first (order) derivative}} of $f$.

\textbf{Example.}\, The first derivative of\, $x\mapsto x^3$\, is\, $x\mapsto 3x^2$\, and the second derivative is\, $x\mapsto 6x$,\, since
$$\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2) = 2\cdot 3x^{2-1} = 6x.$$

If also $f''$ is a differentiable function, its derivative function is denoted by $f'''$ and called the \PMlinkescapetext{{\em third (order) derivative}} of $f$, and so on.

Generally, $f$ can have the derivatives of first, second, third, \ldots, $n$th order, where $n$ may be an arbitrarily big positive integer.\, If $n$ is four or greater, the $n$th derivative of $f$ is usually denoted by $f^{(n)}$.\, In \PMlinkescapetext{addition}, it's sometimes convenient to think that the $0${\em th order derivative} $f^{(0)}$ of $f$ is the function $f$ itself.

The phrase ``$f$ is infinitely differentiable'' means that $f$ has the derivatives of all \PMlinkescapetext{orders}.
