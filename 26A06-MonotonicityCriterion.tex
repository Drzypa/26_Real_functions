\begin{document}
Suppose that $f\colon [a,b] \to \mathbb R$ is a function which is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$.

Then the following relations hold.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
$f'(x)\ge 0$ for all $x\in (a,b)$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is an increasing function on $[a,b]$;
\item
$f'(x)\le 0$ for all $x\in (a,b)$  $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a decreasing function on $[a,b]$;
\item
$f'(x)>0$ for all $x\in (a,b)$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a strictly increasing function on $[a,b]$;
\item
$f'(x)<0$ for all $x\in (a,b)$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a strictly decreasing function on $[a,b]$.
\end{enumerate}

Notice that the third and fourth statement cannot be inverted. As an example consider the function $f\colon [-1,1]\to \mathbb R$, $f(x)=x^3$. This is a strictly increasing function, but $f'(0)=0$.
