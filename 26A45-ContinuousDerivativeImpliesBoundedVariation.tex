\textbf{Theorem.}\, If the real function $f$ has continuous derivative on the interval \,$[a,\,b]$,\, then on this interval,
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is of bounded variation,
\item $f$ can be expressed as difference of two continuously differentiable monotonic functions.
\end{itemize}

{\em Proof.}\, $1^{\underline{o}}$. The continuous function $|f'|$ has its greatest value $M$ on the closed interval \,$[a,\,b]$,\, i.e.
$$|f'(x)| \leqq M \quad \forall x \in [a,\,b].$$
Let $D$ be an arbitrary partition of\, $[a,\,b]$,\, with the points 
$$x_0 = a < x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_{n-1} < b = x_n.$$
Consider $f$ on a subinterval \,$[x_{i-1},\,x_i]$.\, By the mean-value theorem, there exists on this subinterval a point $\xi_i$ such that\, $f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1}) = f'(\xi_i)(x_i-x_{i-1})$.\, Then we get
$$S_D := \sum_{i=1}^n|f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1})| = \sum_{i=1}^n|f'(\xi_i)|(x_i-x_{i-1}) \leqq M\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-x_{i-1}) 
= M(b-a).$$
Thus the total variation satisfies
$$\sup_{D}\{\mbox{all }S_D\mbox{'s}\} \leqq M(b-a) < \infty,$$
whence $f$ is of bounded variation on the interval\, $[a,\,b]$.

$2^{\underline{o}}$. Define the functions $G$ and $H$ by setting
$$G := \frac{|f'|+f'}{2}, \quad H := \frac{|f'|-f'}{2}.$$
We see that these are non-negative and that\, $f' = G-H$.\, Define then the functions $g$ and $h$ on\, $[a,\,b]$\, by
$$g(x) := f(a)+\int_a^xG(t)\,dt, \quad h(x) := \int_a^xH(t)\,dt.$$
Because $G$ and $H$ are non-negative, the functions $g$ and $h$ are monotonically nondecreasing.\, We have also
$$(g-h)(x) = f(a)\!+\!\int_a^x(G(t)\!-\!H(t))\,dt = f(a)\!+\!\int_a^xf'(t)\,dt = f(x),$$
whence\, $f = g-h$.\, Since $G$ and $H$ are by their definitions continuous, the monotonic functions $g$ and $h$ have continuous derivatives \,$g' = G$,\, $h' = H$.\, So $g$ and $h$ fulfil the requirements of the theorem.\\

\textbf{Remark.}\, It may be proved that each function of bounded variation is difference of two bounded monotonically increasing functions.
