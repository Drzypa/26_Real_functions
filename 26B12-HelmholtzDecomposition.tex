\begin{document}
The Helmholtz theorem states that any vector $\mathbf{F}$ may be decomposed into an irrotational (curl-free) and a solenoidal (divergence-free) part under certain conditions (given below). More precisely, it may be written in the form:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla \varphi + \nabla \times \mathbf{A}
\end{equation}
where $\varphi$ is a scalar potential and $\mathbf{A}$ is a vector potential. By the definitions of scalar and vector potentials it follows that the first term on the right-hand side is irrotational and the second is solenoidal. The  general conditions for this to be true are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The divergence of $\mathbf{F}$ must vanish at infinity.
\item The curl of $\mathbf{F}$ must also vanish at infinity.
\end{enumerate}
