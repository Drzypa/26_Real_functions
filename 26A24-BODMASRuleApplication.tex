Today I want to share what Is BODMAS Rule & How to use it?

BODMAS rule decides the order of operations for add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc as below shown
B-Brackets (do all operations contained in the brackets first)
O-Orders (powers and square roots etc)
D-Division 
 M-Multiplication
A-Addition 
S- Subtraction

Letâ€™s see an example and check how BODMASS Rule works
30-(2*6+15/3) +8*3/6

Step1: Brackets
2*6+15/3 = 12+5 = 17

Step2: Division
30-17+8*1/2

Step3: Multiplication
30-17+4

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction
30-17+4=17


20+30-5/4*2+ (1+6)
(5-6/4)+9*7
1-6*(2+9)/8


BODMAS Rule is very helpful in solving various algebra math problems.
