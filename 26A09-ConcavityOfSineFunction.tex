\begin{thm}
The sine function is concave on the interval $[0, \pi]$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $x$ and $y$ lie in the interval $[0, \pi/2]$.
Then $\sin x$, $\sin y$, $\cos x$, and $\cos y$ are all
non-negative.  Subtracting the identities
\[
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1
\]
and 
\[
\sin^2 y + \cos^2 y = 1
\]
from each other, we conclude that
\[
\sin^2 x - \sin^2 y = \cos^2 y - \cos^2 x .
\]
This implies that $\sin^2 x - \sin^2 y \ge 0$ if and only if
$\cos^2 y - \cos^2 x \ge 0$, which is equivalent to stating
that $\sin^2 x \ge \sin^2 y$ if and only if $\cos^2 x \le
\cos^2 y$.  Taking square roots, we conclude that 
$\sin x \le \sin y$ if and only if
$\cos x \ge \cos y$. 

Hence, we have
\[
(\sin x - \sin y) (\cos x - \cos y) \le 0 .
\]
Multiply out both sides and move terms to conclude
\[
\sin x \cos x + \sin y \cos y \le \sin x \cos y + \sin y \cos x .
\]
Applying the angle addition and double-angle identities for the
sine function, this becomes
\[
{1 \over 2} \left( \sin (2x) + \sin (2y) \right) \le \sin (x + y) .
\]
This is equivalent to stating that, for all
$u,v \in [0, \pi]$,
\[
{1 \over 2} \left( \sin u + \sin v \right) \le
\sin \left( {u + v \over 2} \right) ,
\]
which implies that $\sin$ is concave in the interval $[0, \pi]$.
\end{proof}
